# WireGuard Easy

[WireGuard Easy](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy) is the easiest way to run [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/) VPN + Web-based Admin UI.

Another more powerful alternative for a self-hosted WireGuard VPN server is [Firezone](firezone.md). WireGuard Easy is easier, lighter and more compatible with various ARM devices.


## Dependencies

This service requires the following other services:

- a [Traefik](traefik.md) reverse-proxy server
- a modern Linux kernel which supports WireGuard


## Configuration

To enable this service, add the following configuration to your `vars.yml` file and re-run the [installation](../installing.md) process:

```yaml
########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# wg-easy                                                              #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################

wg_easy_enabled: true

wg_easy_hostname: wg-easy.example.com

# The default WireGuard port is always 51820 in the container,
# but the advertised port can be configured via the web UI during the initial setup.
# If you'll be using a port other than 51820, uncomment and change the line below
# to make the container publish the port that you've chosen.
# wg_easy_container_wireguard_bind_port: 51820

########################################################################
#                                                                      #
# /wg-easy                                                             #
#                                                                      #
########################################################################
```

### URL

In the example configuration above, we configure the service to be hosted at `https://wg-easy.example.com/`.

Previously, a `wg_easy_path_prefix` variable was supported for hosting wg-easy at a sub-path, but [this is no longer the case since wg-easy v15](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy/issues/1704#issuecomment-2704400679).


### Networking

**In addition** to ports `80` and `443` exposed by the [Traefik](traefik.md) reverse-proxy, the following ports will be exposed by the WireGuard containers on **all network interfaces**:

- `51820` over **UDP**, controlled by `wg_easy_container_wireguard_bind_port` - used for [Wireguard](https://www.wireguard.com/) connections

Docker automatically opens these ports in the server's firewall, so you **likely don't need to do anything**. If you use another firewall in front of the server, you may need to adjust it.

### Additional configuration

The new wg-easy version (after the v15 release) does not support most of the environment variables that were supported in previous versions.
Most of the configuration happens via the web UI after installation. See [Adjusting the post-installation configuration](#adjusting-the-post-installation-configuration) for more details.

Nevertheless, if you need to inject additional environment variables, you can do so with this additional configuration:

```yaml
wg_easy_environment_variables_additional_variables: |
  INSECURE=true
```

ðŸ’¡ Injecting this `INSECURE` environment variable like this is pointless, since the Ansible role provides a dedicated variable for controlling it (`wg_easy_environment_variables_additional_variable_insecure`).


## Usage

After installation, you can go to the wg-easy URL, as defined in `wg_easy_hostname` and `wg_easy_path_prefix`.

It will ask you to sign up with a username and a password and configure your VPN hostname and WireGuard port advertised to clients.
The WireGuard port in the container is always 51820/udp and the exposed port is controlled by `wg_easy_container_wireguard_bind_port` (defaulting to `51820` as well).

You can then create various Clients and import the configuration for them onto your devices - either by downloading a file or by scanning a QR code.


### Adjusting the post-installation configuration

#### Adjusting the default DNS

Previously, wg-easy supported a `WG_DEFAULT_DNS` environment variable, which allowed one to configure the default DNS server for clients.

Now, the default DNS is hardcoded to `1.1.1.1` & `2606:4700:4700::1111` and [cannot be changed via the web UI yet](https://github.com/wg-easy/wg-easy/issues/1704#issuecomment-2704291491).

You can adjust this by using sqlite on the server (`sqlite3 /mash/wg-easy/data/wg-easy.db`) and running the following queries:

```sql
--- Update the default DNS server for new clients belonging to any of the users.
--- To limit this to a specific user, specify a WHERE clause like `WHERE id = 'wg0'`.
UPDATE user_configs_table SET default_dns = '["192.168.1.5","2001:db8:1234:5678::5"]';

--- Update the default DNS server for existing clients belonging to any of the users.
--- To limit this to a specific user, specify a WHERE clause via the `id` or `user_id` columns.
UPDATE clients_table SET dns = '["192.168.1.5","2001:db8:1234:5678::5"]';
```
